## Implementation Tips

### Assignment 1 Hints

1. **get_at_position**: 
   - Check bounds first: `if position < 0 or position >= self.size`
   - Use a loop to traverse `position` number of times
   - Return `current.data` when you reach the target

2. **delete_at_position**:
   - Handle deletion at head separately (position 0)
   - For other positions, find the node BEFORE the one to delete
   - Update pointers to skip the deleted node



### Assignment 2 Hints

1. **play_song_at_position**:
   - Convert from 1-based to 0-based: `zero_based_pos = position - 1`
   - Validate range: `if position < 1 or position > len(self.songs)`

2. **next_song/previous_song**:
   - Check if movement is possible before updating position
   - Handle edge cases (beginning/end of playlist)

3. **remove_current_song**:
   - After deletion, adjust `current_position` if needed
   - If you delete the last song, move position back by 1

---

## Success Criteria

### Assignment 1
- [ ] `get_at_position` correctly retrieves data and handles errors
- [ ] `delete_at_position` removes nodes and updates size properly
- [ ] All test cases pass without errors

### Assignment 2
- [ ] `play_song_at_position` correctly sets current song
- [ ] `next_song` and `previous_song` navigate properly
- [ ] `remove_current_song` deletes and adjusts position
- [ ] **BONUS**: `find_songs_by_artist` returns correct matches

---

## Testing Your Code

After implementing each method, run the test functions to verify your work:

```python
# Test Assignment 1
test_basic_linked_list()

# Test Assignment 2  
test_music_playlist()
```

The test functions will show you exactly what's working and what needs fixing. Use the output to debug your implementations!

Good luck! Remember that linked lists are all about managing pointers correctly. When in doubt, draw the list structure on paper to visualize what should happen.
